The Sliding Brick Puzzle is a simple one player game which involves moving a specified block around a board towards a goal position, while navigating obstacles.

This project implements a system to play the game using several algorithms. Hence, it is possible to measure their relative performance.

This project is a work in progress. Algorithms currently implemented include random, BFS, DFS and A*. The Manhattan distance from the goal is used as the heuristic for the latter.
